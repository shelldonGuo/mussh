	SITUATION A (using ssh-agent):
	You run mussh and ssh-agent loads your default rsa/dsa key.  You
	are prompted for your passphrase, you enter it, mussh executes
	the commands, kills ssh-agent, and exits.

[doughnut@extradot doughnut]$ mussh -h swing slide junglegym -c 'rpm -q emacs'
Need passphrase for /home/doughnut/.ssh/identity
Enter passphrase for doughnut@extradot.yourdomain.com:
Identity added: /home/doughnut/.ssh/identity (doughnut@extradot.yourdomain.com)
 
junglegym: package emacs is not installed
slide: package emacs is not installed
swing: package emacs is not installed




	SITUATION B (using passwords):
	You run mussh but don't have RSA/DSA keys set up.  When mussh connects
	to each host, it prompts you for the password.  After completing 
	the last host, mussh exits.

[doughnut@extradot doughnut]$ mussh -h swing slide junglegym -c 'rpm -q emacs'
/home/doughnut/.ssh/identity: No such file or directory
 
doughnut@junglegym's password:
junglegym: package emacs is not installed
doughnut@slide's password:
slide: package emacs is not installed
doughnut@swing's password:
swing: package emacs is not installed





	SITUATION C (ssh-agent already running):
	If you are already running ssh-agent with the keys loaded, mussh 
	will not load keys unless you tell it to with the -i flag.

[doughnut@extradot doughnut]$ mussh -h swing slide junglegym -c 'rpm -q emacs'
 
junglegym: package emacs is not installed
slide: package emacs is not installed
swing: package emacs is not installed





	SITUATION D (everything but a goat):
	This example uses almost everything you could.  Specifying hosts
	on the command line AND in a file with comments and blank lines, 
	executing commands from the command line and from a file, forcing
	a unique agent to be loaded, using multiple keys (both RSA and DSA),
	and turing debug mode on for verbose output.

	SITUATION E (asynchronous mode with ssh-agent already running):
	Asynchronous mode (-m) allows you to get done a lot quicker by
	not having to wait for one host to finnish before moving on to
	the next.
