v0.6 (BETA)
2005-06-11:
	- added '-s' to ssh-agent calls so that they will work
	  for people with non-bash shells.  (thanks to Jacob)
	- Asynchronous mode works.
	- Asynchronous mode required temp files so we use 
	  mktemp to make it safer.
	- Blocking option in async mode.
	- All debug messages go to STDERR.
	- Invoke remote shell (default bash) explicitely.
	- SIGQUIT (ctrl-\) prints current/remaining host(s).
	- Modernized all ``'s to $()'s.

v0.5
2002-07-30:

	  and not sourced.
2002-02-11:
	- Created rpm spec file.

v0.4
2002-01-22:
	- Added Feature: -l and -L allow you to specify login
	  name from the command line.
	- Malcolm found a bug where mussh would hang with
	  "StrictHostKeyChecking=ask".  Added "BatchMode=yes"
	  and changed how mussh handles STDIN/STDERR so that
	  those hosts will fail immediately.
	- Removed '-q' flag to ssh since above change makes it 
	  hide errors from ssh.
	- Fixed broken -U mussh flag.

v0.3
2001-11-24:
	- Separated mussh debug (-d) from ssh debug (-v).

	  with '-C' or '-H' to get values from STDIN.
2001-06-05:
	- Got rid of blank line produced by hosts with no output.

v0.2beta2
2001-06-03:
	- Fixed bug with -q.  Quiet mode was turning on -d debug.
